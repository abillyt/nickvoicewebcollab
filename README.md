## Operating statement / Purpose Statement / Mission Statement: 
To establish a fun and engaging social site for writers, voice over artists, and listeners. 

## basic nature of site operation: <br>
Users will be either: Writer, Reader, or Listener (or BUSINESS*)<br>
They may be one, two, or all three of the user types. <br> 
In all three user types, there are three levels of expertise; Amatuer (A), Pro (P), and Master (M) <br>
membership is free <br> 

## site features: <br>
Options for Most and Least popular (and other options) short stories on side bar to right. <br>
Top 10s list - expandable from a splash page NUMBER 1 series (meaning, "Here's the <br>
most listened to read of a story today" and then, upon clicking, the list expands to the top 10 most listened to)<br>
Implement keyword tags, to easily search a genre, search users, trending stories/stories of the week, play random, create playlist.<br>
"Readers" on the site will read the short stories and record their own narration of it. <br>
"Writers" may submit short stories <br>
Users are disallowed from interacting/rating/commenting on audio they haven't listened to.<br>
Ability to record through the site (pipe dream?) <br>


## user abilities: <br>
Follow users <br>
Share stories to facebook, twitter... any social media. <br>
Writers earn credit by submitting stories, and earn or lose credit based on the social reaction to the particular story. <br>
Interaction with narrations: upvote/like + tagged(as hilarious!, excellent!, impression!, difficult listen!, creepy! - multiple marks are allowed in the same interaction)<br>
Readers earn credit for recording narrations and based on the social reaction to their read.<br>
Listeners earn credit for interacting/reviewing with stories/reads after listening. <br>
After listening, users have the option to: rate the story, rate the read, rate both <br>
NOTE: Credit is weighted depending on who is rating the work - if a Master is rating the work, it holds MUCH more weight than an amatuer <br>

## once the site gets going: <br>
Advertisements on the site, sponsored stories: All advertisements must be read by site users! <br>
create a symbiotic relationship between advertisers and readers/writers <br> 
(down the line) create an app for on-the-go listening. <br>

abillyt's frontrunner: Listen Here - listenhere.com or listen-here.com or listen.here<br>
